Acceleration
The rate at which an object's velocity changes over time.
Amplitude
The maximum extent of a vibration or displacement of a sinusoidal oscillation, measured from the position of equilibrium.
Capacitance
The ability of a system to store an electric charge, measured in farads.
Electric Field
A field around charged particles that exerts a force on other charged particles, measured in newtons per coulomb.
Entropy
A measure of the disorder or randomness in a system, which tends to increase over time according to the second law of thermodynamics.
Frequency
The number of cycles per unit time of a periodic wave or oscillation, measured in hertz.
Gravitational Potential Energy
The energy an object possesses because of its position in a gravitational field, calculated as the product of its mass, gravitational acceleration, and height.
Kinetic Energy
The energy an object possesses due to its motion, calculated as half the product of its mass and the square of its velocity.
Magnetic Field
A field produced by moving electric charges and magnetic dipoles, which exerts a force on other moving charges and magnetic dipoles, measured in teslas.
Momentum
The product of an object's mass and velocity, representing the quantity of motion an object has.
Newton's First Law
A principle stating that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion at constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force.
Photon
A quantum of electromagnetic radiation, which has zero rest mass and carries energy proportional to the radiation frequency.
Potential Energy
The energy stored in an object due to its position, condition, or configuration.
Quantum Mechanics
The branch of physics that deals with the behavior of particles on an atomic and subatomic scale, where the principles of wave-particle duality and probability govern.
Work
The transfer of energy that occurs when a force is applied to an object over a distance, calculated as the product of the force and the distance in the direction of the force.
