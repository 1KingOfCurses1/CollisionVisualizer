Elastic Collision
A collision where kinetic energy is conserved, and the objects bounce off each other without lasting deformation or heat generation.
Inelastic Collision
A collision where kinetic energy is not conserved, and the objects may stick together or deform, generating heat and sound.
Perfectly Inelastic Collision
A type of inelastic collision where the colliding objects stick together after impact, moving with a common velocity.
Impact Force
The force exerted by objects on each other during a collision, which can be very large over a short time period.
Collision Time
The duration over which a collision occurs, typically very short in high-speed impacts.
Impulse
The product of the force applied during a collision and the time over which it is applied, equal to the change in momentum.
Coefficient of Restitution
A measure of the elasticity of a collision, defined as the relative velocity of separation divided by the relative velocity of approach.
Conservation of Momentum
A principle stating that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant before and after a collision.
Center of Mass
The point in a system of bodies or an extended body where the total mass can be considered to be concentrated for the purposes of analyzing motion and collisions.
Relative Velocity
The velocity of one object as observed from the reference frame of another object, crucial in determining the dynamics of a collision.
Shock Wave
A type of propagating disturbance that carries energy and can form in supersonic impacts, causing sudden and severe pressure changes.
Crush Zone
A designated area in a structure designed to deform in a controlled manner during a collision to absorb energy and reduce impact forces.
Deformation
The change in shape or size of an object due to the forces exerted during a collision, which can be elastic or plastic.
Energy Absorption
The process by which the kinetic energy of colliding objects is transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat, sound, and deformation energy.
Rebound Velocity
The speed and direction of an object after it has collided and separated from another object, especially in elastic collisions.
